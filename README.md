## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwewhy/FinalProjRhythmGame.git
```

2. Environment Setup:
   - Install IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE (Processing IDE is NOT compatible)
   - Install JDK (Java Development Kit)

3. Project Configuration:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
   - Ensure the Processing core library (core_3.5.4.jar) is properly configured in project dependencies:
     - Go to File → Project Structure → Libraries
     - Click '+' to add a new library
     - Navigate to and select the core_3.5.4.jar file
     - Click 'Apply' and 'OK'

4. Building and Running:
   - Open src/FinalProjRhythmGame.java
   - Build and run the project using your IDE's run configuration

⚠️ **Important Notes:**
- This project MUST be run in a Java IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, not in the Processing IDE
- The project uses Processing's core libraries but follows Java project structure and syntax
- Make sure all dependencies are properly configured before running

## 🎮 How to Play
1. Launch the game
2. Follow the falling stars pattern
3. Click or press designated keys in sync with the music
4. Watch for visual feedback through fireworks and particles
5. Try to achieve the highest score possible
